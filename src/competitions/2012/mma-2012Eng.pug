            p.
              The participants in the fights: <a href="../../girls/kara-tellerEng.html">Kara Teller</a>  (Moscow, 5’7” / 121 lb) and Svetlana Solovyova (St. Petersburg, 5’7” / 124 lb). There is no need to specially introduce Kara anymore. It is not for the first time that she is taking part in the competitions in St. Petersburg. You could call her fighting style “street fight”. Svetlana is very strong physically. She prefers striking combat sports, such as boxing or kickboxing.<br>
              Quite obviously, Svetlana Solovyova (St. Petersburg; 5’7” / 124 lb) was superior to Kara in physical power. For example, dynamometric measures of her hand grip strength were 56.3 kg (124 lb), which was more than her own weight! But on Kara’s side was her fighting experience that made up for the lack of her strength during their fight.
            p.
              In the beginning, when the girls were exchanging blows and kicks in stand up, Svetlana was still able to somehow withstand Kara’s attacks, but when the fight was brought to the ground, Kara’s advantage became more evident. Kara won by a choke hold in 1:13.

            p.
              Since Kara’s fight against Svetlana was not long enough and did not exhaust the girls too much, we decided to continue our sporting entertainment with an additional (not scheduled) fight in MMA between <b>Kara</b> and <b>Tais</b> (St. Petersburg, 5’7” / 132 lb).
            p.
              Note that this was the second time they met each other on a wrestling mat. In their previous fight, as you remember, Tais defeated Kara.<br>
              This time the fight between them was even more aggressive and strenuous and lasted two and a half times longer. Kara was even able to take over for a short while from time to time. However, this was not enough to hold out too long against powerful Tais who again, as in their first fight, showed her ability to dominate and, after a few minutes of struggling, finished Kara off with a choke.

              By the end of our sporting event, <b>Kara Teller</b> and <b>Svetlana Solovyova</b> tested their strengths in a submission grappling fight with each other.

            p.
              The fight ended in a draw. Unfortunately, the physically more powerful Svetlana didn't have enough skill to defeat Kara, while the more skillful Kara wasn’t strong enough to handle Svetlana. Though who knows, maybe if the girls had not grown so tired, the outcome of their fight could have been different.
