              <b>Varvara Akulova</b> (born 1992, 5'9" / 165 lb) is a great athlete. As a child and teenager she was several times recognized as the strongest girl on the planet, which was twice confirmed by the Guinness Book of World Records. Varvara's strength results in the various periods of her life have been presented, for example, on the <a href="https://warnet.ws/2007/07/13/varvara-akulova-samaya-silnaya-devochka-na-planete-39-foto.html">official website of the St. Petersburg Athletic Center</a>.

            p.
              The fight is fought in the grappling style. The intrigue of it is that nobody knows in advance who would win in the end. The principal question is WHICH will be better, the skill or pure strength.

            p.
              It is really a hard fight! Clearly a big, strong Varvara does not want to lose to her smaller opponent. In turn, Tais would like nothing better than to beat the bigger and stronger athlete to demonstrate her skill and competitiveness. Who will prevail?
