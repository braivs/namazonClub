              The Submission Grappling tournament <b>"Christmas Cup 2011"</b>, organized by the Namazon Club and Kempo-Kan School of Martial Arts, was held on 6 January 2011 in the sport hall of a school. It was fought in two rounds. In the tournament participated: <b>Natalia Mysik</b> (5'11" / 154 lb),  <b>Ksenia Voloshina</b> (5'3" / 141 lb)  and <b>Valentina Perfilyeva</b>  (5'8" / 139 lb).<br>
              A feature of the competition was a big disparity in weight and height between the wrestlers. One of them (Natalia) was much heavier and taller than the others. Using this advantage, she frequently put her opponents in pinning holds, especially School Girl Pins, which she would then easily turn into armlocks or chokes. One of these chokes even resulted in her opponent’s knockout.

            p Finally, Natalia became a winner. Ksenia and Valentina took 2nd and 3rd places respectively.
            p Beyond the tournament, there was a prize fight between <b>Tais</b> (5'7" / 127 lb) and <b>Natalia Mysik</b> (5'11" / 154 lb).

              The tournament she had won exhausted Natalia. That helped Tais afterwards to gain a convincing victory over her.
