              The tournament was held in two rounds on a beach, with each fight fought without time limit. There were 4 fighters contesting in the official part of the tournament. Two Namazonian girls: <b>Tais</b> (5’7” / 130 lb) - repeated winner of the club tournaments on submission grappling; champion and prizewinner of competitions of different ranks on kickboxing, karate and sanda and <b>Elena Vasilyeva</b> (5’6” / 135 lb) - a young, promising girl. And two male wrestlers: <b>Alex</b> (5’9” / 154 lb) and <b>Villian</b> (5’8” / 177 lb). Both men participated repeatedly in competitions on submission grappling.<br>
              <b>Villian</b> and <b>Tais</b> were the favorites in the tournament. They both handled their opponents without much difficulty. Villian defeated Alex in both fights.

              Tais also held two victories over both Elena Vasilyeva and Alex. And at that, while Villian won all his fights by choking his opponents, Tais used various techniques including chokes, body scissors, neck scissors and different pain holds.

              The struggle for the 3rd place between Elena Vasilyeva and Alex was especially tough. Let it suffice to say that their first fight lasted more than 12 minutes and the organizers of the tournament regretted that they hadn’t provided the division of the fights into rounds. In the end Elena won by a choke hold.
