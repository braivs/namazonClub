            h4 Submission Grappling tournament for the prize of the Namazon Club. October, 2014  
            p.
              In this October Grappling tournament participated three girls. Two of them had competed with each other at <a href="tournament-2014Eng.html">the grappling tournament between beginners</a> that took place on the 9th of May 2014 at the Club. And now, just as then, Victoria Vardugina (144 lb) came out a winner. Christina Shvets (152 lb) now took the 2nd place (a little better than in May); and the newcomer of our competitions Zoya Doroeeva (124 lb) remained on the 3rd place.

            p.
              The fights were generally conducted under Submission Grappling rules; however, a win could be also secured by pinning an opponent’s back to the mat for a 5 count pin.<br>
              The tournament was held in two rounds. The fights of the first round lasted for 4 minutes each. If there was no winner within the regular full time, the fight was interrupted for a rest break of 2 mins, then the opponents wrestled on for another two minutes.<br>
              In the 2nd round, after the four minutes of the regular time and two minutes of rest, the girls continued to fight hard for 10 minutes of overtime!

            h5 <u>Christina Shvets vs Zoya Dorofeeva</u>
            p.
              Even though Zoya was a newcomer in our competitions, she was not a total beginner in combat sports. Her experience included several years of training in the Russian martial arts. Hence, despite the great disparity in weight (Christina - 152 lb, Zoya - 124 lb), both fights between the girls were almost evenly matched and very strenuous. Suffice it to say that in the first round of their contest, during the four minutes of the regular time plus two extra minutes the two opponents were not able to decide between them who would win the fight. After the six mins of struggle there was still a draw.<br>
              However, in the 2nd round, the stronger Christina defeated Zoya by pinning her down before the end of the regular time.

            p.
              Victoria beat Zoya easily enough, choking her to submission in both rounds within the regular time. It should be pointed out, though, that there were a few moments when Zoya could take over the initiative and even submit Victoria, but she just wasn’t able to materialize those opportunities.

            p.
              Christina and Victoria had met each other five months ago at the <a href="tournament-2014.html">grappling tournament between beginners</a>. That time Victoria had celebrated victory in a very hard-fought match. Christina had trained a lot since then, doing her best to improve in wrestling. She had gained weight, strength and experience, which made her a real fighter and dangerous opponent for other girls on the wrestling mat. Vika, by contrast, had reduced her weight, so by the time of their October encounter she had been outweighed by 8 pounds. We wondered whether Christina would be able to take advantage of it and avenge her last loss to Victoria. Anyway, the fight between these two rivals promised to be an interesting one. And so it turned out to be. In the first round, neither regular time nor overtime revealed the winner. It was a draw. In the 2nd round, only on the 10th minute of the extra time Victoria managed to submit Christina with a choke hold.
              By the end, both wrestlers were exhausted. The girls’ physical fitness and wrestling endurance appeared to be the decisive factors here, which just added even more to this intense and exciting final bout.<br>
