              In the final, Lida and Vika faced each other on the mat. They were offered to wrestle a submission style match, even though they had never tried this kind of combat before. It turned out to be an extremely tough struggle between almost evenly matched opponents. In spite of her big weight advantage, Vika could not for a long time overcome Lida who didn’t give up and fought back proving herself a tough and smart wrestler.

            p.
              Besides the three pairs of competitors in the amateur division there was created a special <b>absolute division</b> in which the opponents had to compete with each other in one round to determine a winner. One of the competitors in the absolute division was <b>Yulia Borovik</b> who, in view of her significant weight advantage over the other girls (she weighed 201 lb), was put against the most experienced wrestler in the Club, <b>Tais</b>.

            p.
              Powerful Yulia did not give Tais any chance in the tug of war fight. She expected to win the arm wrestling contest too, but to her disappointment, Tais’s arms turned out to be clearly stronger than hers. Then there was a hard struggle between the two ladies in the leg wrestling matches – Tais had a tough time, but she was able to tie the contest. So eventually the final winner between them had to be decided through a submission wrestling match that was scheduled for the last round of the tournament. That last match was pretty exciting and far from being one sided, because Yulia proved to be a very strong wrestler in terms of physical power. Tais got her hands full with that big and ambitious woman who did not want to lose to her much smaller and lighter opponent. It took Tais all her experience and wrestling skill to remain in the top position throughout the majority of the match and finally to bring Yulia to submission.
