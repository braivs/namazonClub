              <b>Submission grappling</b> (Submission wrestling) is a non-striking hybrid style formed of wrestling, jiu jitsu, sambo, and many other submission fighting styles which consists in applying submission holds and choking tech-niques in order  to make the  opponent  aban-don the fight.   Submission  grappling  plays an important  role in  the  practice of <b>Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)</b> and is considered an effective form of <b>self-defense</b>.
