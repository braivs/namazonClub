              <b>MMA</b> ((Mixed Martial Arts) is a full contact com-bat  sport  that  allows the use of both striking and grappling arts while both standing and on the ground, including wrestling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, sambo, judo, boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, karate and other styles. The roots of mo-dern mixed martial arts can be traced back to the ancient  Olympic  combat  sport of Pankration.
