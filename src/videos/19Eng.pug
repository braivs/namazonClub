            h4 Varvara Akulova vs Tais.  Submission Grappling.  May, 2012
            p.
              <b>Varvara Akulova</b>  is a great athlete. As a child and teenager she was several times recognized as the strongest girl on the planet, which was twice confirmed by the Guinness Book of World Records. Varvara's strength results in the various periods of her life have been presented, for example, on the official website of the <a href="http://www.spb-ac.ru/var.htm">St. Petersburg Athletic Center</a>. Look also <a href="http://warnet.ws/news/16167">here</a>.

              <a href="http://fakty.ua/130242-menya-osuzhdali-mol-doch-vyrastet-mutantom-da-u-varvary-do-500-predlozhenij-braka-v-internete-ezhemesyachno">Today</a>,  Akulova is an acting sportswoman, master of sports in weightlifting and in powerlifting. Her height/weight are 175 cm (5'9'') / 75 kg (165 lb).
              <b>Tais</b> (5'7" / 130 lb) is the leader of the Namazon Club. She specializes in wrestling and MMA.

              In this fight Varvara has a significant advantage in weight (about 33 lb) and in strength, but Tais is more experienced and technically skilled. The fight is fought in the grappling style. The intrigue of it is that nobody knows in advance who would win in the end. The principal question is <b>WHICH will be better, the skill or pure strength</b>.

            p.
              It is really a hard fight! Clearly a big, strong Varvara does not want to lose to her smaller opponent. In turn, Tais would like nothing better than to beat the bigger and stronger athlete to demonstrate her skill and competitiveness. Who will prevail?
