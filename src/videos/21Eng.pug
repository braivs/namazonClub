            h4 MMA. Darya Balina vs Olga. July, 2012
            p.
              This is the second MMA fight at the <b>"First Nevsky Arena Tournament"</b>. <b>Darya Balina</b> (5'4" / 124 lb) and  <b>Olga</b> (5'7" / 139 lb) are young participants, who don't have yet enough experience in MMA fights, but that doesn't make their fight less interesting or entertaining; their punches are still strong, the struggle is tough.

            p.
              The girls are fighting three full rounds, and no one of them wants to give up.
            p If you don't like fights with a great amount of punches and kicks then you might perhaps be a little bit disappointed when watching this fight. However, if you love real, hard, uncompromising fights then youâ€™ll definitely like their match.
