            h4 Mixed wrestling. Villian vs Tais. Part 1. 2014
            p.
              In comparison with Alexandr whom you can see on our  <a href="38Eng.html">VIDEO 38</a>,  <b>Villian</b> doesn’t look so big and strong. He weighs only 180 pounds. But he is much faster and far more experienced and skilled in wrestling. In their personal fights with each other Villian usually comes out a winner. However, <b>Tais</b> who is 44 lb lighter than Villian says that it’s easier for her to fight Villian than Alexandr because in her fights against him she is better able to successfully apply her technique.
